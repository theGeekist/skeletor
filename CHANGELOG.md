## [0.3.1] - 2024-12-19

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: CLI argument structure redesigned for better UX:
  - `apply` command: `CONFIG_FILE` is now a positional argument instead of `-i` flag
    - Old: `skeletor apply -i my-template.yml`
    - New: `skeletor apply my-template.yml`
  - `info` command: `CONFIG_FILE` is now a positional argument instead of `-i` flag
    - Old: `skeletor info -i my-template.yml`
    - New: `skeletor info my-template.yml`
  - `snapshot` command: ignore flag changed from `-I` to `-i` for consistency
    - Old: `skeletor snapshot -I "*.log"`
    - New: `skeletor snapshot -i "*.log"`

## Migration Guide for v0.3.0

**CLI Changes:**
- Error messages now use lowercase prefixes: `error:`, `info:`, `tip:`
- Professional emoji usage maintained for visual appeal
- Verbose dry-run provides detailed operation listings

**New Library API:**
```rust
use skeletor::{SkeletorConfig, apply_config};

let config = SkeletorConfig::from_yaml_file("template.yml")?;
let result = apply_config(&config, Path::new("./output"), false, false)?;
```
