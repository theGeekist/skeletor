## [0.3.1] - 2024-12-19

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: CLI argument structure redesigned for better UX:
  - `apply` command: `CONFIG_FILE` is now a positional argument instead of `-i` flag
    - Old: `skeletor apply -i my-template.yml`
    - New: `skeletor apply my-template.yml`
  - `info` command: `CONFIG_FILE` is now a positional argument instead of `-i` flag
    - Old: `skeletor info -i my-template.yml`
    - New: `skeletor info my-template.yml`
  - `snapshot` command: ignore flag changed from `-I` to `-i` for consistency
    - Old: `skeletor snapshot -I "*.log"`
    - New: `skeletor snapshot -i "*.log"`
- All help documentation and examples updated to reflect new CLI syntax

### Fixed
- Test suite fully updated to work with new argument structure
- CLI flag consistency across all subcommands

## [0.3.0] - 2024-12-19

### Added
- **Library API**: Comprehensive Rust library with `SkeletorConfig` and `apply_config()` for programmatic usage
- **Reporter System**: Flexible output with `DefaultReporter` and `SilentReporter` traits
- **CLI Hygiene**: Professional output with selective emojis and lowercase prefixes (`error:`, `info:`, `tip:`)
- **Enhanced Testing**: Improved test coverage to 82.51% with comprehensive edge case validation
- **Colored Output**: Professional terminal formatting with battle-tested CLI conventions

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Replaced all emoji symbols with professional equivalents following CLI hygiene standards:
  - üìÅ `Dir:` for directory operations (emoji + lowercase prefix)
  - üìÑ `File:` for file operations (emoji + lowercase prefix)
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è `info:` for informational messages (emoji + lowercase prefix)
  - ‚úÖ `success:` for successful operations (emoji + lowercase prefix)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è `warning:` for warnings (emoji + lowercase prefix)
  - `error:` for errors (no emoji, color conveys importance, lowercase)
  - üöÄ `start:` for operation initiation
  - ‚ö° `progress:` for progress updates
  - ÔøΩ `snapshot:` for snapshot operations
  - ÔøΩ `output:` for file output indicators
  - ‚è±Ô∏è `duration:` for timing information
- Modernized error messages with professional tone and actionable guidance using lowercase `tip:` prefix
- Enhanced dual CLI/library architecture supporting both interactive and programmatic usage
- Improved test coverage with comprehensive integration test suite

### Fixed
- Compilation errors in apply.rs due to duplicate function definitions
- Missing imports and unused dependency warnings
- Critical test failures in snapshot module

## Migration Guide for v0.3.0

**CLI Changes:**
- Error messages now use lowercase prefixes: `error:`, `info:`, `tip:`
- Professional emoji usage maintained for visual appeal
- Verbose dry-run provides detailed operation listings

**New Library API:**
```rust
use skeletor::{SkeletorConfig, apply_config};

let config = SkeletorConfig::from_yaml_file("template.yml")?;
let result = apply_config(&config, Path::new("./output"), false, false)?;
```
